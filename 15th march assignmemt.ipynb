    "Artificial Intelligence (AI): Artificial Intelligence refers to the development of computer systems or software that can perform tasks that typically require human intelligence. This includes tasks like problem-solving, decision-making, understanding natural language, and recognizing patterns. AI can be divided into two categories: narrow or weak AI (designed for specific tasks) and general or strong AI (possessing human-like intelligence).\n",

    "Machine Learning (ML): Machine Learning is a subset of AI that focuses on the development of algorithms and models that enable computers to learn from data and make predictions or decisions without being explicitly programmed. ML algorithms improve their performance over time as they are exposed to more data.\n",
    "Example: A spam email filter that learns to classify emails as spam or not based on patterns in the content and user feedback is an example of machine learning.\n",
