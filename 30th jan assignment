Q5-
A while loop in Python is used to execute a block of code repeatedly until a certain condition is met.
The condition is checked at the beginning of each iteration of the loop, and the loop continues to execute as long as the condition is true.
Once the condition becomes false, the loop terminates and the code execution continues with the next line of code.

example-
count = 1
while count <= 5:
    print(count)
    count += 1
