When a thread is started using the start() method, the calling thread can use join() to pause its execution and wait until the thread being joined has finished executing. This is often used to ensure that the main thread waits for all other threads to complete before proceeding.\n",

It returns a boolean value indicating whether the thread has started and has not yet completed its execution. If a thread has finished executing or has not been started, isAlive() will return False. This method can be helpful to check the status of a thread and make decisions based on its execution state."
