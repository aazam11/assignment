You can override the run() method in a custom Thread subclass to define the specific task or behavior you want the thread to execute.\n",

Once the start() method is called, the thread begins its execution, and any code specified in the run() method will be executed concurrently with other threads.\n",

    "#join(): The join() method is used to wait for a thread to complete its execution. When a thread is started using the start() method, the calling thread can use join() to pause its execution and wait until the thread being joined has finished executing. This is often used to ensure that the main thread waits for all other threads to complete before proceeding.\n",

It returns a boolean value indicating whether the thread has started and has not yet completed its execution. If a thread has finished executing or has not been started, isAlive() will return False. This method can be helpful to check the status of a thread and make decisions based on its execution state."
