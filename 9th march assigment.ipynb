    "Q1: Probability Mass Function (PMF) and Probability Density Function (PDF):\n",
    "Probability Mass Function (PMF):\n",
    "A PMF is used in the context of discrete random variables. It gives the probability that a discrete random variable takes on a specific value.\n",
    "The PMF is denoted as P(X = x), where X is the random variable and x is a specific value.\n",
    "Example: Consider rolling a fair six-sided die. The PMF for the outcome of rolling the die is:\n",
    "P(X = 1) = 1/6\n",
    "P(X = 2) = 1/6\n",
    "P(X = 3) = 1/6\n",
    "P(X = 4) = 1/6\n",
    "P(X = 5) = 1/6\n",
    "P(X = 6) = 1/6\n",
    "Probability Density Function (PDF):\n",
    "A PDF is used for continuous random variables. It describes the likelihood of a continuous random variable taking on a particular value within a range.\n",
    "The PDF is represented as f(x), and the probability of the variable falling within an interval [a, b] is given by the integral of the PDF over that interval.\n",
    "Example: The PDF of a standard normal distribution is the bell-shaped curve represented by the equation f(x) = (1 / √(2π)) * e^(-x^2/2), where x is a real number.\n",
    "\n",
    "Q2: Cumulative Density Function (CDF):\n",
    "The Cumulative Density Function (CDF) describes the probability that a random variable takes on a value less than or equal to a given value.\n",
    "It is denoted as F(x), and for a continuous variable, it is calculated by integrating the PDF from negative infinity to x.\n",
    "Example: For the standard normal distribution, the CDF is represented as F(x) = ∫(from -∞ to x) (1 / √(2π)) * e^(-t^2/2) dt. This function gives the probability that a standard normal random variable is less than or equal to x.\n",
    "The CDF is useful because it allows us to calculate probabilities associated with a random variable taking on values within a specified range.\n",
    "\n",
    "Q3: Examples of situations where the normal distribution might be used:\n",
    "Heights of individuals in a population.\n",
    "Test scores of a large group of students on a standardized test.\n",
    "Measurement errors in scientific experiments.\n",
    "The distribution of IQ scores in a population.\n",
    "The parameters of the normal distribution are the mean (μ) and the standard deviation (σ). μ determines the center of the distribution, and σ controls the spread or width of the distribution. Larger values of σ result in wider distributions.\n",
    "\n",
    "Q4: Importance of Normal Distribution:\n",
    "The normal distribution is essential in statistics and data analysis because of its prevalence in real-world phenomena.\n",
    "It simplifies many complex situations by providing a well-understood model.\n",
    "It is the basis for many statistical tests and methods, such as hypothesis testing, confidence intervals, and regression analysis.\n",
    "Real-life examples of Normal Distribution:\n",
    "\n",
    "Heights of a population.\n",
    "IQ scores in a population.\n",
    "Test scores in a large group of students.\n",
    "Measurement errors in scientific experiments.\n",
    "The distribution of blood pressure in a healthy population.\n",
    "\n",
    "Q5: Bernoulli Distribution:\n",
    "The Bernoulli distribution models a binary outcome, where an event can have two possible outcomes, usually labeled as 0 and 1.\n",
    "It is characterized by a single parameter p, which represents the probability of a success (1) on a single trial.\n",
    "Example: Coin flipping, where success (1) represents getting heads, and failure (0) represents getting tails.\n",
    "Difference between Bernoulli and Binomial Distribution:\n",
    "Bernoulli distribution models a single trial with two outcomes, while the binomial distribution models the number of successes in a fixed number of independent Bernoulli trials.\n",
    "Bernoulli has one parameter (p), whereas the binomial has two parameters (n and p), where n is the number of trials.\n",
    "\n",
    "Q6: Probability that a randomly selected observation will be greater than 60 from a normal distribution with mean 50 and standard deviation 10:\n",
    "First, calculate the z-score for x = 60 using the formula: Z = (X - μ) / σ\n",
    "Z = (60 - 50) / 10 = 1\n",
    "Next, find the probability using a standard normal distribution table or calculator. P(Z > 1) is the probability that a standard normal random variable is greater than 1.\n",
    "Lookup P(Z > 1) in a standard normal distribution table or use a calculator, which is approximately 0.1587.\n",
    "So, the probability that a randomly selected observation from this normal distribution will be greater than 60 is approximately 0.1587.\n",
    "\n",
    "Q7: Uniform Distribution:\n",
    "The uniform distribution is a probability distribution where all outcomes within a given range are equally likely.\n",
    "It has a constant probability density within the range and is represented as a rectangular shape on a probability density function graph.\n",
    "Example: Rolling a fair six-sided die, where each outcome (1 to 6) has an equal probability of 1/6.\n",
    "\n",
    "Q8: Z-Score:\n",
    "The z-score (also known as standard score) measures how many standard deviations a data point is away from the mean in a normal distribution.\n",
    "It allows for the comparison of data points from different normal distributions.\n",
    "The z-score is calculated as: Z = (X - μ) / σ, where X is the data point, μ is the mean, and σ is the standard deviation.\n",
    "Importance: It helps in standardizing data and is useful in statistical analysis, hypothesis testing, and identifying outliers.\n",
    "\n",
    "Q9: Central Limit Theorem (CLT):\n",
    "The Central Limit Theorem states that the distribution of the sample means of a large enough random sample from any population will be approximately normally distributed, regardless of the population's underlying distribution.\n",
    "It is significant because it enables the use of normal distribution-based statistical methods even when the original data may not be normally distributed.\n",
    "\n",
    "Q10: Assumptions of the Central Limit Theorem:\n",
    "Random Sampling: The samples should be randomly selected from the population of interest.\n",
    "Independence: The samples should be independent of each other.\n",
    "Sample Size: The sample size should be sufficiently large (typically n ≥ 30) to ensure the approximation to normality.\n",
    "Population Distribution: The underlying population distribution should have a finite mean (μ) and a finite standard deviation (σ)"
