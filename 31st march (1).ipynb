    "Key Steps:\n",
    "\n",
    "Define Requirements: Clearly define the features and functionalities of your web application.\n",
    "Choose Technology Stack: Select the appropriate programming languages, frameworks, and databases. For example, using Node.js, Express, and MongoDB for a MEAN stack application.\n",
    "\n",
    "Front-End Development: Create the user interface using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. Use a front-end framework like React or Angular.\n",
    "\n",
    "Back-End Development: Develop server-side logic and APIs. Use a back-end framework like Express.js (Node.js) or Django (Python).\n",
    "\n",
    "Database Integration: Connect your application to a database. For instance, use MongoDB for a NoSQL database or PostgreSQL for a relational database.\n",
    "\n",
    "Testing: Perform unit, integration, and end-to-end testing to ensure the application functions correctly.\n",
    "\n",
    "Security: Implement security measures, such as HTTPS, input validation, and authentication.\n",
    "\n",
    "Deployment: Choose a cloud provider (e.g., AWS, Azure, Google Cloud) and deploy your application. Use tools like Docker for containerization.\n",
    "\n",
    "Scaling: Configure auto-scaling to handle varying levels of traffic.\n",
    "\n",
    "Monitoring and Maintenance: Implement monitoring tools (e.g., AWS CloudWatch) and regularly update and maintain your application.\n",
    "\n",
    "Practical Example:\n",
    "Consider building a simple task management application using the MERN (MongoDB, Express.js, React, Node.js) stack. Use AWS for deployment and Docker for containerization.\n",

    "Traditional Web Hosting:\n",
    "\n",
    "Server Ownership: You own physical servers or lease dedicated servers from a hosting provider.\n",

    "\n",
    "Scalability: Highly scalable; resources can be scaled up or down based on demand.\n",
    "\n",
