    "#Covariance measures the degree to which two variables change together, but it doesn't provide a standardized measure of the relationship. Covariance can take on any value, and its magnitude is influenced by the scales of the variables.\n",
    "#Correlation, on the other hand, is a standardized measure of the linear relationship between two variables. It ranges from -1 (perfect negative correlation) to 1 (perfect positive correlation), with 0 indicating no linear correlation. Correlation is independent of the scale of the variables and is more interpretable.\n",

    "#Q14. Outliers can significantly affect measures of central tendency and dispersion:\n",
    "#Measures of Central Tendency: Outliers can pull the mean in their direction, making it unrepresentative of the typical values in the dataset. The median is less affected by outliers since it is less influenced by extreme values.\n",
    "#Measures of Dispersion: Outliers can increase the range, variance, and standard deviation of the dataset, as they introduce more variability. This may not accurately reflect the spread of the majority of the data.\n",
    "#For example, consider a dataset of monthly salaries where most employees earn between $40,000 and $60,000 per year, but one executive earns $10 million. The mean salary would be heavily influenced by the executive's outlier value, making it much higher than the typical salary of the employees."
